I am not responsible for bricked devices, corrupt sdcards,
thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. 
Please do some research if you have any concerns about features 
included in this mod before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make 
these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up 
your device, I will laugh at you.
